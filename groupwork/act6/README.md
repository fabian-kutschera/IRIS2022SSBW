# Linux Tutorial 7: Seismic Wave Travel Times and Ray Paths with TauP

## 5 What should your full command and options look like?

`taup_curve -ph P --gmt -h 0`

## 11 There is a term seismologists use to describe these features. What is it and what does it tell us about the Earth?

- Triplications in the travel time curve result from three different ray paths which tells us about discontinuities in the earth associated with changes in seismic properties from one layer to the next.

## 16 Which of the following is the correct command with options?

`taup_path -ph ttp -deg 100 --gmt -h 0`

## 25 How would this help explain why the travel time curve ends at 100 degrees?

- The outer core creates a shadow zone. To get distances larger than 100 degrees, the ray path would have to go through the slower liquid outer core, which would cause it to turn downward and end up at a further distance than expected.
