# IRIS 2022 Seismology Skill Building Workshop OSL

Welcome to our journey into scientific computing in seismology! We are excited to you chose to join us and look forward to seeing you grow in your skills and understanding as the workshop progresses. The opportunity to actively develop skills and understanding in an interactive setting is what makes this workshop so valuable because traditional university coursework does not typically offer these opportunities.
